## 1.Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

### 1.1 Problem Statement (OPT Version)

Given the set of distances **(fully connected graph)**, order n cities in a tour vi1, vi2,..., vin with i1 = 1.

To minimize âˆ‘ d(vij, v(ij+1)) + d(vin, vi1)

### 1.2 Decision Version of TSP

Given a set of distance on n cities and a bound D, is there a tour of Length/Cost at most D 

#### (a). Hamiltonian Cycle

A cycle C in G is a Hamiltonian cycle if it visits each vertex exactly once

#### (b). Definition
