# *Chapter 6 The Link Layer and LANs*

### 1. Architecture

#### 1.1 Single Hop

- WiFi:

- Enterprise WiFi:

- Cellular: Macro Base Station

- 5G: Mini Base Station

- Internet of Things(IOT):



Wired vs Wireless:

- You cannot just put a new fiber to increase capacity

- Inteference



#### 1.2 Multiple Hop

- Sensor Networks:  Fire prevention， Earthquake Monitoring， Manufactory Monitoring



- Mesh Networks(网状网络): Omnidirectional Networks，Directional Networks



- Mobile ad hoc Networks(移动随意网络) : Vehicular networks



- Intermittently connected wireless / Delay tolerant Networks: 

  space communication, Military applications, Disaster recovery

  

### 2. Topics

#### 2.1 PHY

- radio propagation

- digital modulation

- tradeoff: rate vs power vs error

  rate increase -> error increase

  power increase -> error decrease

  SNR: signal to noise ratio

  SINR: signal to liberty to noise ratio

- fading

​	OFDM, OFDMA

​	MIMO, 802.11 

#### 2.2 MAC

- Randomized access

​		aloha, slotted aloha, CSMA

- rate regions, saturation throughput 

- power control

- CHarmelfed 

  TDMA, FDMA

### 2.3 Routing

- reactive routing protocol 

  AODV, OCSR, Backpressure routing, Spray and route

- routing metrics

  ETX

#### 2.4 Transport

- problem with TCP

  a packet does not necessarily means that there is congestions

- fairness

#### 2.5 Other topics

- Mobility
- Security, Privacy
